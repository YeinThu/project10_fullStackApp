# Project 10 - Full Stack App with React and a REST API

## Project Details
* Using the REST API from Project 9 (school database),
  we will know create the front-end of our application
  using REACT.
* With the UI now available, clients can now immersively
  interact with our school database. They can sign up to be a *user*, that is a member of the school, view their list of courses and details of each individual course. 
* Clients can also create a new course, modify the 
  details of an existing course, or if it's a course 
  that they have completed or just wanting to cancel, they can delete it. These options are only available
  if you are an existing user and/or the respective owner of a course.
* The Sequelize and SQLite data management within the 
  REST API along with the front-end framework of the REACT library help bring this app to life.
